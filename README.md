# jQuery UI Dialog Extra

jQuery UI Dialog Extra adds minimize/maximize/restore buttons to
standard jQuery UI dialog.

See demo.html for details.

I don't maintain this project anymore.
I decided to move it to GitHub to give other people an ability to fork
it and use it.

P.S. Thanks to Joan Molina from http://www.uic.es/ for iframe bug-report
and fix.

P.P.S. Dont look into the code. I know it is weird (:

I will maintain this project started by Mark A. Prisyazhnyuk as I find it 
useful to enhance UI Dialog.
